## 1. No Collection of Personal Information

We are committed to user privacy. The IPFS Uploader plugin is designed to operate without collecting, storing, recording, or transmitting any of your personal information.

## 2. Data You Upload

The core function of this Plugin is to facilitate the upload of files to the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) and their corresponding metadata to a distributed, public blockchain.

### Public by Nature
You must understand that both IPFS and public blockchains are decentralized, public networks. Any data, files, or metadata you choose to upload using this Plugin will be publicly accessible and permanently stored on these networks.

### Your Sole Responsibility
You are solely responsible for the content you choose to upload. We strongly advise against uploading any sensitive, private, proprietary, or confidential information. Once data is uploaded to IPFS or a blockchain, it cannot be easily removed or made private.
